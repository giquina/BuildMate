## Coordination Protocols

### Task Delegation Flow
1. **product-manager** receives high-level requirements
2. Delegates to **system-architecture** for technical planning
3. Delegates to **ux-ui-designer** for user experience design
4. Tier 2 agents coordinate Tier 3 implementation teams
5. Tier 5 specialists provide targeted expertise as needed
6. Tier 4 agents handle final quality assurance and deployment

### Communication Patterns
- **Strategic Decisions**: product-manager → system-architecture / ux-ui-designer
- **Technical Implementation**: system-architecture → backend/frontend engineering
- **Design Implementation**: ux-ui-designer → frontend-engineering + ui/ux specialists
- **Quality Assurance**: All agents → qa-testing → product-manager
- **Deployment**: devops coordinates with all teams → product-manager approval

### Decision Authority Matrix
- **Product Decisions**: product-manager (final authority)
- **Technical Architecture**: system-architecture (with product-manager approval)
- **User Experience**: ux-ui-designer (with product-manager approval)
- **Implementation Details**: Tier 3 agents (within approved architecture)
- **Quality Standards**: qa-testing (with escalation to product-manager)
- **Deployment**: devops (with product-manager approval)

## Current Project: Commercial B2B Platform

### Active Coordination for Commercial Implementation

#### Phase 0: Documentation (Current)
- **docs-maintainer**: Update all project documentation
- **product-manager**: Strategic oversight of documentation updates

#### Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture
