# Update Documentation Slash Command
# Usage: /update-docs

You are tasked with automatically updating all documentation files in the BuildMate AI construction platform project.

## Files to Update:
1. **README.md** - Project overview, installation, construction industry features
2. **CLAUDE.md** - Development guidelines, architecture, construction domain context
3. **docs/*** - All documentation in docs directory
4. **Component Documentation** - React component usage and props
5. **API Documentation** - Construction API endpoints and data structures

## Construction Platform Context:
This is a UK-focused construction platform with:
- AI-powered floorplan generation
- Materials marketplace integration
- Professional contractor network
- E-commerce flow (cart, wishlist, checkout)
- UK building regulations compliance
- Construction project management

## Process:
1. **Scan Codebase**: Analyze current Next.js app structure and construction features
2. **Review Pages**: Check all app router pages for new functionality
3. **Component Analysis**: Review UI components and construction-specific features
4. **API Endpoints**: Document construction API routes and data structures
5. **E-commerce Features**: Document cart, wishlist, checkout, and AI recommendations
6. **Construction Domain**: Update UK construction industry specific documentation
7. **Update Files**: Systematically update all documentation files

## Focus Areas:
- **E-commerce Flow**: Cart, wishlist, favorites, account creation, checkout
- **AI Features**: Floorplan generation, material recommendations
- **Professional Network**: Contractor profiles, ratings, project matching
- **UK Construction**: Building regulations, planning permission, professional standards
- **TypeScript Interfaces**: Construction domain data structures
- **Component Library**: UI components with construction industry context

## Construction Industry Considerations:
- Professional user workflows (architects, builders, contractors)
- Mobile-first design for on-site usage
- UK-specific features (postcodes, building regs, VAT handling)
- Complex project data (budgets, timelines, materials)
- Trust and reliability requirements for construction professionals

## Output Requirements:
- Update documentation to match current implementation
- Add missing documentation for new features
- Ensure construction industry context is clear throughout
- Provide implementation examples with construction use cases
- Update installation and setup instructions
- Document e-commerce and AI recommendation features

Start by analyzing the current BuildMate AI codebase structure and construction features, then systematically update each documentation file with accurate, construction-focused content.
