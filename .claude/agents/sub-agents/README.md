# BuildMate Sub-Agent Hierarchy System

This document describes BuildMate's comprehensive sub-agent hierarchy system, consisting of 54 highly specialized sub-agents organized under 18 parent agents. This system enables efficient task delegation and specialized expertise for all aspects of BuildMate's construction industry platform development.

## Overview

The sub-agent system implements a hierarchical delegation model where parent agents can delegate specific, narrow-focus tasks to specialized sub-agents. This approach ensures:

- **Deep Specialization**: Each sub-agent has narrow, focused expertise in specific domains
- **Efficient Delegation**: Parent agents can delegate without providing broad oversight
- **Quality Assurance**: Specialized agents ensure higher quality outputs in their domains
- **Scalability**: The system supports complex, multi-faceted development tasks

## Architecture

## Communication Protocols

### Delegation Flow
1. **Parent Agent** identifies specialized task requiring sub-agent expertise
2. **Parent Agent** delegates to appropriate sub-agent with clear context and requirements
3. **Sub-Agent** executes specialized task within their domain expertise
4. **Sub-Agent** delivers specific output back to parent agent
5. **Parent Agent** integrates sub-agent output into broader solution

### Inter-Agent Communication
- **Horizontal Communication**: Sub-agents can communicate with peers under same parent
- **Cross-Hierarchy Communication**: Sub-agents can coordinate with related sub-agents under different parents
- **Escalation Path**: Issues escalate through parent agents to appropriate hierarchy level

### Quality Assurance
- **Specialized Review**: Each sub-agent provides expert review within their domain
- **Parent Integration**: Parent agents ensure sub-agent outputs integrate properly
- **Cross-Validation**: Related sub-agents validate each other's outputs when appropriate

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Sub-Agents
- **Specialized Tasks**: Tasks requiring deep expertise in specific domain
- **Complex Features**: Multi-faceted features benefiting from specialized approach
- **Quality Assurance**: Expert review and validation of specialized implementations
- **Efficiency**: Tasks that benefit from narrow focus and specialized knowledge

### Task Assignment Strategy
1. **Identify Specialization**: Determine which specialized domain the task belongs to
2. **Select Sub-Agent**: Choose the most appropriate sub-agent based on task requirements
3. **Provide Context**: Give sub-agent sufficient context about construction industry requirements
4. **Define Deliverables**: Clearly specify expected outputs and quality criteria
5. **Integrate Results**: Parent agent integrates sub-agent deliverables into broader solution
