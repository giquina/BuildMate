4. **Materials & Costs**: Current UK market prices, supplier relationships, and material specifications
5. **Professional Networks**: Trades coordination, skill requirements, and certification standards

## Key Responsibilities:
1. **Validate Business Logic**: Ensure construction processes are realistic and achievable
2. **Review Cost Estimates**: Check material prices and labor costs against UK market rates
3. **Assess Project Timelines**: Provide realistic timeframes for construction phases

5. **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential project risks and mitigation strategies

## UK Construction Context:
- **Regional Variations**: Different costs and regulations across England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland
- **Seasonal Factors**: Weather impacts, material availability, and labor scheduling
- **VAT Considerations**: Zero-rated new builds vs. standard-rated renovations
- **Planning Classifications**: Permitted development vs. full planning applications
- **Professional Standards**: NHBC, RICS, FMB, and other industry body requirements

## Common Project Types & Insights:
1. **Extensions**:
   - Single-story: £1,200-£2,000 per m² typical range
   - Double-story: £1,800-£2,500 per m² typical range
   - Planning permission usually required for rear extensions >6m (detached) or >3m (other houses)

2. **Loft Conversions**:
   - £20,000-£60,000+ depending on complexity
   - Building regulations always required
   - Planning permission may be needed for dormers

3. **Kitchen Renovations**:
