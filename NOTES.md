- **Likely candidates**: Node.js, Python, Go (common for build tools)
- **Next step**: Watch for updates or ask maintainer

## 🔄 Git Workflow I'm Using

### My Branch Strategy
```bash
main                    # Stay synced with upstream
├── explore/setup      # My exploration branch

```

### My Daily Commands
```bash
# Morning routine - check for updates
cd C:\Users\Owner\Projects\BuildMate
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git status

# Starting work
git checkout -b explore/new-feature
