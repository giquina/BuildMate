# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ðŸš€ Claude Code Operating Rules

1. **First think through the problem**, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan using TodoWrite tool.
2. **The plan should have a list of todo items** that you can check off as you complete them.
3. **Before you begin working**, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. **Then, begin working on the todo items**, marking them as complete as you go.
5. **Every step of the way**, give me a high-level summary of the changes you made.
6. **Make every code/task change as simple as humanly possible**. Avoid broad refactors.
7. **Finally, add a review section** to the `todo.md` file summarizing what you did.
8. **DO NOT BE LAZY. NO HALF FIXES.** Find the root cause and fix it properly.
9. **Minimize the code impact of every change**. Simplicity always wins.

## Project Overview
BuildMate is a UK-focused construction platform built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It provides smart floorplan generation, materials marketplace, and professional networking for homeowners, self-builders, and property developers.

**IMPORTANT**: All "AI" terminology has been removed from the platform. Use "smart", "intelligent", or "automated" instead to make the platform accessible to general users unfamiliar with AI terminology.

## Core Architecture

- Protected routes implement proper authentication guards

## Deployment & Production

### Vercel Deployment
- **Production URL**: https://buildmate-ai.vercel.app
- **Repository**: https://github.com/giquina/BuildMate
- **Auto-deployment**: Enabled from `main` branch
- **Environment Variables**: Configured for all environments

### Critical Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for production
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=r8_xxx...        # Smart image generation (ACTIVE)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=xxx         # Database connection
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=xxx        # Server-side database access
OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx                   # Smart floorplan generation
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=xxx                # Payment processing
```

### Static Generation Issues
- Pricing page requires `export const dynamic = 'force-static'` for proper deployment
- Configure page has complex client-side state for image generation
- All pages designed for static generation where possible

### Build Performance
- Bundle size limits: JS (200kb gzipped), CSS (50kb gzipped)
- Performance budget enforced via `bundlesize` package
- Lighthouse scoring optimized for construction industry usage

## API Architecture

### Core API Routes
```
src/app/api/
â”œâ”€â”€ ai/generate/              # Smart floorplan generation (OpenAI integration)
â”œâ”€â”€ generate-image/           # Smart image generation (Replicate/SDXL - ACTIVE)
â”œâ”€â”€ algorithms/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ optimize-timeline/    # Construction timeline optimization
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ match-professionals/  # Professional matching algorithm
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ budget-optimize/      # Cost optimization algorithms
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ recommend-materials/  # Material recommendation engine
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ predict-costs/        # UK construction cost prediction
```

### API Design Patterns
- All routes return consistent `{ success: boolean, data?: any, error?: string }` format
- UK construction industry specific algorithms and data
- Proper error handling with construction context
- Mock data for development, real APIs for production integration

## Future Development Areas

- Test protected route access and authentication guards

## Critical Development Notes

### Performance Hook Usage
The `usePerformanceMonitoring` hook uses `useCallback` and `useRef` to prevent re-renders:
```typescript
const { onMount, measureOperation } = usePerformanceMonitoring('ComponentName')
// Functions are stable - safe to use in useEffect dependencies
```

### Terminology Guidelines
- **Never use**: "AI", "ai-powered", "ai-generated", "artificial intelligence"
- **Always use**: "smart", "intelligent", "automated", "advanced"
- **Function names**: `generateSmartSuggestions`, `smartInsights`, `smartSuggestion`
- **Branding**: "BuildMate" (not "BuildMate AI")

### Authentication Hook Usage
The authentication system uses custom hooks with proper dependency management:
```typescript
const { user, isAuthenticated, login, logout } = useUser()
const { projects, saveProject, updateProject } = useUserProjects()
const { wishlist, addToWishlist, removeFromWishlist } = useWishlist()
// All hooks return stable references - safe for useEffect dependencies
```

### Mock Authentication Development
- Use demo credentials: `demo@buildmate.co.uk` / `demo123`
- Session persisted in localStorage for development convenience
- All user data is mock data for development/testing
- Forms validate UK-specific formats (postcodes, phone numbers)

### Stability Considerations
- Avoid complex webpack optimizations that can cause module loading errors
- Use minimal Next.js experimental features to prevent runtime issues
- Ensure all React hooks have stable dependencies to prevent Fast Refresh errors
- Test development server stability after major changes
- Authentication context should be wrapped at root level in layout.tsx

When working on this codebase, always consider the construction industry context, UK market requirements, user authentication requirements, and the needs of professional users who rely on the platform for significant financial decisions.
