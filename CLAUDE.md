# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ðŸš€ Claude Code Operating Rules

1. **First think through the problem**, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan using TodoWrite tool.
2. **The plan should have a list of todo items** that you can check off as you complete them.
3. **Before you begin working**, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. **Then, begin working on the todo items**, marking them as complete as you go.
5. **Every step of the way**, give me a high-level summary of the changes you made.
6. **Make every code/task change as simple as humanly possible**. Avoid broad refactors.
7. **Finally, add a review section** to the `todo.md` file summarizing what you did.
8. **DO NOT BE LAZY. NO HALF FIXES.** Find the root cause and fix it properly.
9. **Minimize the code impact of every change**. Simplicity always wins.

## Project Overview
BuildMate is a UK-focused construction platform built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It provides smart floorplan generation, materials marketplace, and professional networking for homeowners, self-builders, and property developers.

**IMPORTANT**: All "AI" terminology has been removed from the platform. Use "smart", "intelligent", or "automated" instead to make the platform accessible to general users unfamiliar with AI terminology.

## Construction Industry Context

### UK-Specific Considerations
- **Building Regulations**: Current UK compliance requirements
- **Planning Permission**: Permitted development vs. full applications
- **Regional Pricing**: London vs. regional cost variations
- **Professional Standards**: RIBA, NHBC, FMB certifications
- **VAT Handling**: Zero-rated new builds vs. standard-rated renovations

### User Personas
- **Homeowners**: First-time builders, extension planners
- **Self-Builders**: Experienced DIY enthusiasts
- **Property Developers**: Commercial and residential developers
- **Professionals**: Architects, builders, tradespeople

### Industry Standards
- **Typical Costs**: Extensions Â£1,200-Â£2,500/mÂ², new builds Â£1,500-Â£3,000/mÂ²
- **Timeline Expectations**: Extensions 12-20 weeks, new builds 12-24+ months
- **Compliance Requirements**: Building regs, planning permission, professional certifications

## Component Development Guidelines

### UI Component Patterns
- All components export from `src/components/ui/index.ts`
- Support multiple variants (size, color, state)
- Include proper TypeScript interfaces for props
- Implement accessibility features (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
- Follow naming convention: `ComponentName`, `ComponentVariant`

### Animation Standards
- Use CSS transforms for performance
- Duration: 200-300ms for interactions
- Easing: Professional, subtle effects
- Classes: `.animate-float`, `.animate-slide-up`, `.card-hover-lift`

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach (construction professionals use mobile on-site)
- Breakpoints: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px)
- Touch-friendly interactions (minimum 44px touch targets)
- Progressive enhancement for desktop features

## API Development

### Endpoint Patterns
- Use Next.js API routes in `src/app/api/`
- Implement proper error handling with status codes
- Include TypeScript interfaces for request/response
- Mock external APIs during development (OpenAI, supplier APIs)

### Data Validation
- Validate UK postcodes using utilities in `uk-utils.ts`
- Sanitize user inputs for construction project data
- Implement proper error messages for construction-specific validation

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript Usage
- Avoid `any` types - use proper interfaces
- Define interfaces for all API responses and component props
- Use utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit) where appropriate
- Implement type guards for runtime validation

### Component Architecture
- Single responsibility principle
- Reusable components with clear interfaces
- Consistent naming and file organization
- Proper separation of concerns (UI vs. business logic)

## Development Hooks

Auto-commit hook is configured to:
- Run type-check and lint on code changes
- Automatically commit if no errors found
- Skip commit if type errors or linting issues exist

## Smart Image Generation System

### Replicate Integration (ACTIVE)
The platform uses Replicate + SDXL for professional architectural rendering:

**API Endpoint**: `/api/generate-image`
- **Model**: `stability-ai/sdxl` with expert ensemble refiner
- **Cost**: ~Â£0.002 per image (very affordable)
- **Quality**: Professional photography quality, 1024x768px
- **Styles**: Modern, Traditional, Contemporary, Victorian UK architecture

**Implementation Details**:
```typescript
// Configure page auto-generates 4 architectural style images
const architecturalStyles = [
  { id: 'modern', prompt: 'modern UK house with large windows...' },
  { id: 'traditional', prompt: 'traditional British house, red brick...' },
  { id: 'contemporary', prompt: 'contemporary UK house, glass and steel...' },
  { id: 'victorian', prompt: 'Victorian UK house, period elegance...' }
]
```

**Environment Setup**:
- Requires `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` in environment variables
- Already configured for all Vercel environments (production/preview/development)
- Falls back gracefully if API fails

### User Experience Flow
1. User visits `/configure` page
2. Shows "Images: 1/4 generating..." with loading spinners
3. Images generate in parallel (15-30 seconds each)
4. User selects preferred architectural style
5. Selection saved and passed to materials page

## Key Implementation Notes

### Mock Data Strategy
- Smart generation uses mock SVG and data structures for floorplans
- Professional and material data includes realistic UK market information
- Case studies and testimonials reflect authentic UK construction scenarios
- **Image generation is LIVE** - uses real Replicate API for architectural renders

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading for construction images and material catalogs
- Optimized bundle sizes for mobile usage
- Efficient component rendering for large data sets (materials, professionals)

### Security Requirements
- No API keys in client-side code
- Proper input validation for all construction project data
- Secure handling of professional credentials and certifications

## Deployment & Production

### Vercel Deployment
- **Production URL**: https://buildmate-ai.vercel.app
- **Repository**: https://github.com/giquina/BuildMate
- **Auto-deployment**: Enabled from `main` branch
- **Environment Variables**: Configured for all environments

### Critical Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for production
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=r8_xxx...        # Smart image generation (ACTIVE)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=xxx         # Database connection
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=xxx        # Server-side database access
OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx                   # Smart floorplan generation
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=xxx                # Payment processing
```

### Static Generation Issues
- Pricing page requires `export const dynamic = 'force-static'` for proper deployment
- Configure page has complex client-side state for image generation
- All pages designed for static generation where possible

### Build Performance
- Bundle size limits: JS (200kb gzipped), CSS (50kb gzipped)
- Performance budget enforced via `bundlesize` package
- Lighthouse scoring optimized for construction industry usage

## API Architecture

### Core API Routes
```
src/app/api/
â”œâ”€â”€ ai/generate/              # Smart floorplan generation (OpenAI integration)
â”œâ”€â”€ generate-image/           # Smart image generation (Replicate/SDXL - ACTIVE)
â”œâ”€â”€ algorithms/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ optimize-timeline/    # Construction timeline optimization
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ match-professionals/  # Professional matching algorithm
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ budget-optimize/      # Cost optimization algorithms
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ recommend-materials/  # Material recommendation engine
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ predict-costs/        # UK construction cost prediction
```

### API Design Patterns
- All routes return consistent `{ success: boolean, data?: any, error?: string }` format
- UK construction industry specific algorithms and data
- Proper error handling with construction context
- Mock data for development, real APIs for production integration

## Future Development Areas

### Planned Integrations
- Real OpenAI API implementation for floorplan generation
- Live supplier API connections (Travis Perkins, Wickes, B&Q)
- Payment processing with Stripe for materials purchases
- Professional verification system integration

### Feature Roadmap
- Advanced smart features for project optimization
- Real-time collaboration tools for project teams
- Mobile app development for on-site usage
- Integration with UK planning permission systems

## Testing Strategy

### Component Testing
- Test all UI components across construction industry use cases
- Verify responsive design on mobile devices
- Validate accessibility features for professional users

### Integration Testing
- Mock external APIs (suppliers, OpenAI, payment systems)
- Test construction project workflows end-to-end
- Validate UK-specific business logic and calculations

## Critical Development Notes

### Performance Hook Usage
The `usePerformanceMonitoring` hook uses `useCallback` and `useRef` to prevent re-renders:
```typescript
const { onMount, measureOperation } = usePerformanceMonitoring('ComponentName')
// Functions are stable - safe to use in useEffect dependencies
```

### Terminology Guidelines
- **Never use**: "AI", "ai-powered", "ai-generated", "artificial intelligence"
- **Always use**: "smart", "intelligent", "automated", "advanced"
- **Function names**: `generateSmartSuggestions`, `smartInsights`, `smartSuggestion`
- **Branding**: "BuildMate" (not "BuildMate AI")

### Stability Considerations
- Avoid complex webpack optimizations that can cause module loading errors
- Use minimal Next.js experimental features to prevent runtime issues
- Ensure all React hooks have stable dependencies to prevent Fast Refresh errors
- Test development server stability after major changes

When working on this codebase, always consider the construction industry context, UK market requirements, and the needs of professional users who rely on the platform for significant financial decisions.
