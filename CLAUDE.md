# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ðŸš€ Claude Code Operating Rules

1. **First think through the problem**, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to `tasks/todo.md`.
2. **The plan should have a list of todo items** that you can check off as you complete them.
3. **Before you begin working**, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. **Then, begin working on the todo items**, marking them as complete as you go.
5. **Every step of the way**, give me a high-level summary of the changes you made.
6. **Make every code/task change as simple as humanly possible**. Avoid broad refactors.
7. **Finally, add a review section** to the `todo.md` file summarizing what you did.
8. **DO NOT BE LAZY. NO HALF FIXES.** Find the root cause and fix it properly.
9. **Minimize the code impact of every change**. Simplicity always wins.

â”œâ”€â”€ types/                 # TypeScript type definitions
```

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Component System**: Centralized UI components with variants (Button, Card, Badge, etc.)
2. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
3. **UK Market Focus**: Specialized utilities in `uk-utils.ts` for postcodes, pricing, regulations
4. **Construction Domain**: Strong typing for projects, materials, professionals, quotes
5. **API Architecture**: RESTful endpoints with proper error handling and mock data

### Data Models

Core entities are defined in `src/types/index.ts`:
- **User**: Subscription tiers (free/pro/enterprise), UK postcode integration
- **Project**: Construction types (new_build/renovation/extension), status tracking
- **Floorplan**: AI-generated SVG data with specifications
- **Material**: UK supplier integration, categories, pricing
- **Professional**: UK trades with certifications, insurance verification
- **Quote**: Professional estimates with timeline and status

### UI Design System

Components follow construction industry aesthetics:
- **Colors**: Professional blues, construction oranges, trust-building greens
- **Mobile-First**: Optimized for on-site construction usage
- **Animations**: Subtle, professional (200-300ms), hardware-accelerated
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant with proper ARIA labels

## Development Commands

### Essential Commands
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run build        # Production build
npm run lint         # ESLint code quality check
npm run type-check   # TypeScript compilation check
```

### Development Workflow
1. Always run `npm run type-check` before committing code changes
2. Use `npm run lint` to maintain code quality standards
3. Test UI changes across mobile/desktop breakpoints
4. Verify construction industry context in all features

## Construction Industry Context

### UK-Specific Considerations
- **Building Regulations**: Current UK compliance requirements
- **Planning Permission**: Permitted development vs. full applications
- **Regional Pricing**: London vs. regional cost variations
- **Professional Standards**: RIBA, NHBC, FMB certifications
- **VAT Handling**: Zero-rated new builds vs. standard-rated renovations

### User Personas
- **Homeowners**: First-time builders, extension planners
- **Self-Builders**: Experienced DIY enthusiasts
- **Property Developers**: Commercial and residential developers
- **Professionals**: Architects, builders, tradespeople

### Industry Standards
- **Typical Costs**: Extensions Â£1,200-Â£2,500/mÂ², new builds Â£1,500-Â£3,000/mÂ²
- **Timeline Expectations**: Extensions 12-20 weeks, new builds 12-24+ months
- **Compliance Requirements**: Building regs, planning permission, professional certifications

## Component Development Guidelines

### UI Component Patterns
- All components export from `src/components/ui/index.ts`
- Support multiple variants (size, color, state)
- Include proper TypeScript interfaces for props
- Implement accessibility features (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
- Follow naming convention: `ComponentName`, `ComponentVariant`

### Animation Standards
- Use CSS transforms for performance
- Duration: 200-300ms for interactions
- Easing: Professional, subtle effects
- Classes: `.animate-float`, `.animate-slide-up`, `.card-hover-lift`

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach (construction professionals use mobile on-site)
- Breakpoints: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px)
- Touch-friendly interactions (minimum 44px touch targets)
- Progressive enhancement for desktop features

## API Development

### Endpoint Patterns
- Use Next.js API routes in `src/app/api/`
- Implement proper error handling with status codes
- Include TypeScript interfaces for request/response
- Mock external APIs during development (OpenAI, supplier APIs)

### Data Validation
- Validate UK postcodes using utilities in `uk-utils.ts`
- Sanitize user inputs for construction project data
- Implement proper error messages for construction-specific validation

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript Usage
- Avoid `any` types - use proper interfaces
- Define interfaces for all API responses and component props
- Use utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit) where appropriate
- Implement type guards for runtime validation

### Component Architecture
- Single responsibility principle
- Reusable components with clear interfaces
- Consistent naming and file organization
- Proper separation of concerns (UI vs. business logic)

## Sub-Agents Available
