## 🚀 Vercel Deployment Status

The previous deployment errors were caused by:

2. Missing `CheckCircle` import in generate page - **FIXED** 
3. Incomplete component with missing variables - **FIXED**

**Next deployment should succeed** as all compilation errors have been resolved.

## 🎨 Design System Notes

Left CSS class names (like `tesla-600`) unchanged as they are:
- Internal styling references only
- Part of the color system in tailwind.config.js
- Not visible to users
- Would require extensive refactoring affecting design consistency

Focused on removing user-facing company references while maintaining design quality.
