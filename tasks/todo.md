---

## 🔹 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED FOR CORRECTION

### 1. HOMEPAGE COST CLAIMS - REQUIRES IMMEDIATE CORRECTION ❌

**ISSUE**: Unrealistic savings claims
- "£15k architectural fees saved" - UNREALISTIC
- **REALITY**: Typical architectural fees are 8-15% of build cost
- **PROBLEM**: For £200k project, architect fees would be £16k-£30k, not £15k savings

**CORRECTED CLAIM**: "Save up to £5,000 on professional coordination fees"

### 2. TIMELINE PROMISES - MISLEADING ❌

**ISSUE**: "3 minutes to configure, 18 months to move in"
- **REALITY**: Planning permission alone takes 8-13 weeks minimum
- **PROBLEM**: Sets unrealistic client expectations

**CORRECTED TIMELINE**: "3 minutes to configure, realistic 24-36 month journey including all approvals"

### 3. PROFESSIONAL AVAILABILITY CLAIMS - UNREALISTIC ❌

**ISSUE**: Immediate professional assignment implied
- **REALITY**: Quality professionals are booked 2-6 months ahead
- **PROBLEM**: Creates false expectations of instant service

**CORRECTED APPROACH**: "Connect with verified professionals - typical availability 4-8 weeks for quality trades"

### 4. MATERIAL PRICING - NEEDS REGIONAL CONTEXT ⚠️

**CURRENT**: Fixed pricing without regional variations
**REQUIRED**: Add London premium (30-50%), regional discounts for Scotland/Wales (10-20%)
