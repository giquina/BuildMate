# Claude Code Project Setup - Detailed Plan

## Project Analysis
**Current State**: Existing Next.js TypeScript project (BuildMate AI - Construction Platform)
**Language Detected**: TypeScript/JavaScript (Next.js)
**Approach**: Integrate Claude tooling structure with existing codebase

---

## üîπ STEP 1 ‚Äì Project Bootstrap (Claude Task)

### Directory Structure Creation
- [ ] Create `/tests` directory for test files
- [ ] Create `/docs` directory for documentation
- [ ] Create `/claude` directory for Claude-specific files
- [ ] Create `/claude/subagents/` subdirectory
- [ ] Create `/tasks` directory (already exists)
- [ ] Create `/errors` directory for error tracking
- [ ] Create `/scripts` directory for automation scripts

### Initial File Creation
- [ ] Update existing `README.md` with project setup info
- [ ] Update existing `CLAUDE.md` with operating rules
- [ ] Create `tasks/todo.md` (this file)
- [ ] Create `errors/debug.log` for error tracking
- [ ] Create `scripts/bootstrap.sh` for setup automation

### Git Setup
- [ ] Verify git repo status (appears to already exist)
- [ ] Create/update `.gitignore` for Next.js TypeScript project
- [ ] Ensure all new directories are tracked

---

## üîπ STEP 2 ‚Äì CLAUDE.md Operating Rules

### Rules to Insert
1. First think through problems, read codebase, write plan to `tasks/todo.md`
2. Create todo list with checkboxes
3. Check with user before execution
4. Work through todos, marking complete
5. Provide high-level summaries of changes
6. Keep changes simple, avoid broad refactors
7. Add review section to `todo.md` when complete
8. NO LAZY FIXES - find root causes
9. Minimize code impact - simplicity wins

---

## üîπ STEP 3 ‚Äì Subagent Discovery + Setup

### Proposed Subagents for BuildMate AI
1. **doc-writer**: Maintains documentation for construction industry features
2. **ui-component-auditor**: Reviews React components for consistency and accessibility
3. **type-checker**: Ensures TypeScript interfaces align with construction domain
4. **api-validator**: Validates API endpoints and data structures
5. **performance-monitor**: Identifies Next.js performance optimization opportunities

### Implementation Plan
- [ ] Create subagent definition files in `/claude/subagents/`
- [ ] Each subagent gets proper system prompts and tool access
- [ ] Focus on construction industry domain knowledge
- [ ] Ensure no risky server-related operations

---

## üîπ STEP 4 ‚Äì Slash Command for Auto-Updating Docs

### /update-docs Command Features
- [ ] Scan recent codebase changes (git diff analysis)
- [ ] Auto-update README.md with current features
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with new patterns/components
- [ ] Update all files in `/docs/` directory
- [ ] Sync component documentation with actual implementations
- [ ] Update API documentation based on route changes

---

## üîπ STEP 5 ‚Äì GitHub Auto-Commit Claude Hook

### Hook Requirements
- [ ] Trigger only on successful code execution
- [ ] Run TypeScript compilation check (`npm run type-check`)
- [ ] Run linting (`npm run lint`) 
- [ ] Only commit if both pass
- [ ] Generate smart commit messages with construction context
- [ ] NO dev server or process startup during hook

### Implementation
- [ ] Create `.claude/settings.local.json` hook configuration
- [ ] Add post-tool-call hook with error checking
- [ ] Include git permissions in settings
- [ ] Test hook behavior with safe operations

---

## üîπ STEP 6 ‚Äì Claude Context Memory File

### claude/context.json Contents
- [ ] File structure mapping
- [ ] Key React components and their purposes
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces for construction domain
- [ ] API endpoints and their functionality
- [ ] UK construction industry specific modules
- [ ] Next.js app router structure
- [ ] Component library organization

---

## üîπ STEP 7 ‚Äì Optional Slash Command: /project-health

### Health Check Features
- [ ] Count remaining tasks in `todo.md`
- [ ] Recent commit activity analysis
- [ ] Files changed today/this week
- [ ] Unresolved bugs in `errors/debug.log`
- [ ] TypeScript error count
- [ ] Component test coverage status
- [ ] Claude's assessment of repo health

---

## üîπ STEP 8 ‚Äì Final GitHub Commit

### Prerequisites Checklist
- [ ] All subagents created and tested
- [ ] Hooks and slash commands implemented
- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated with complete rules
- [ ] todo.md updated with review section
- [ ] All new files properly structured
- [ ] Git status clean except for intentional changes

### Final Commit
- [ ] Comprehensive commit message
- [ ] Include summary of all Claude tooling added
- [ ] Tag as major setup milestone

---

## Special Considerations for BuildMate AI

### Construction Industry Context
- All tooling should understand UK construction domain
- Subagents should be familiar with building regulations
- Documentation should reflect professional construction use cases
- Error handling should consider construction project complexity

### Next.js Specific Setup
- Ensure compatibility with App Router structure
- Account for TypeScript strict mode
- Consider Tailwind CSS custom components
- Maintain component library organization

### Security Considerations
- No API keys or sensitive construction data exposure
- Professional network data handling compliance
- Payment integration safety (Stripe)
- User project data protection
