## 📝 Code Conventions

### Terminology Guidelines
- **Platform Branding**: "BuildMate AI" (official platform name)
- **Feature Naming**: "AI-powered", "AI-generated", "AI insights" (technical accuracy)
- **User-Facing Copy**: Emphasize "smart", "intelligent", "automated" for accessibility
- **Function Names**: `generateAISuggestions`, `aiInsights`, `aiRecommendation`
- **Marketing Copy**: Balance AI capabilities with user-friendly smart terminology

### File Naming
- **Components**: `PascalCase.tsx` (e.g., `AnimatedProgressBar.tsx`)

### TypeScript Standards
- Use strict TypeScript - no `any` types
- Define interfaces for all props and data structures
- Export types with components for reusability
- Implement type guards for runtime validation

### Performance Considerations
- Use `useCallback` and `useRef` in performance hooks to prevent re-renders
- Avoid complex webpack optimizations that can cause module loading errors
